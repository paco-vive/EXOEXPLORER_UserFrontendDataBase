# EXOEXPLORER: EXOEXPLORER Frontend with Data Base 

**EXOEXPLORER** is an innovative space exploration app designed for the [NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/). This app provides a main interface with three key modes:

1. **3D Simulation**  
   A simulation based on NASA's exoplanet database that accurately depicts stars as listed on their website. Users can explore a realistic 3D space environment and navigate through stars and constellations.

2. **ExoGame**  
   The ExoGame mode includes a constellation memory game and, in future updates, will feature a story mode. The story mode is a 2D space adventure developed in Unity, offering an engaging storyline set in outer space.

3. **Augmented Reality (AR) Mode**  
   The AR mode will render stars and draw constellations in 3D based on the original simulation. While time constraints prevented full integration, this feature is planned for future updates to enhance immersive exploration.

We are **ExoExplorer**—thank you for exploring with us!
